p I’ve been a researcher for two years and have done lots of projects to understand user needs. I’m used to doing desk research and have started lots of projects by first understanding existing norms. I have experience working with designers and developers and am comfortable working in an agile way with them. I’ve done a lot of research with different types of users and have got them all to consent to it by getting them to sign a disclaimer.
