      p Over the next couple of years, our rights as digital citizens will change. 
      p In May 2018, the European Parliament’s General Data Protection regulation will affect how services handle our data, security and privacy online. For the first time, our right to challenge algorithmic decision making, our right to correct data and even our right to have our data erased will be protected.
      p Groups like the ICO are explaining what the regulations mean for organisations. They’re looking at GDPR as a matter of compliance. We think it’s a design problem.
      p Even the most mundane of activities, like shopping for groceries, could change as these new rights emerge. And because the regulation will affect any service whose users include European citizens, it’s going to set a precedent around the world. 
      p This is a chance to think about the kind of services we want to see online. 
      p We’ve developed several prototypes that take new approaches to data and privacy. Each responds differently to the rights described by these new regulations. Each is a tiny, mostly mundane illustration of what our digital future could look like.
      p Our job as designers is to look at these new rights and think about what services and tools they open up. To think about the possibilities, try stuff out, learn and improve.
