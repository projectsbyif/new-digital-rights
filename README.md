# Our Digital Rights

Our rights as digital citizens are changing.

The General Data Protection Regulation affects the way services handle our data, security and privacy. 

For the first time, we will have the right to challenge automated decision making, to correct data and even to have our data erased. Even everyday activities, like shopping for groceries, could change as these new rights emerge. 

But this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. When the cookie law came into force in 2012, it didn’t give people more control over their personal data. It just created a new, low bar for compliance: the cookie banner.

Our job as designers is to look at these new rights and think about what services and tools they open up. The following prototypes explore that. Each is a tiny, mundane illustration of what our digital futures could look like.
