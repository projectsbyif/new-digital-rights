# Designing for new digital rights

The General Data Protection Regulation gives people new rights for personal data.

It gives people the right to challenge automated decisions, to restrict how personal data is used, and to move data from service to service.

As designers, our job is to look at these new rights and think about what they make possible. If we don’t, then it’s likely that these new rights will just disappear into the small print.

The following clickable prototypes are examples of what could come next.
